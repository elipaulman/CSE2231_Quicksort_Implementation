# Lab 1
Elijah Paulman

## Requirements to Run the Lab

- Python 3

## Running the Lab

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `lab1.py`.
3. Run the command `python3 lab1.py`.

This will execute the quicksort function on a randomly generated array of 1000 elements, 
print the first 10 elements of the unsorted and sorted arrays, and display the time taken 
to sort the array. It will also run a unit test to verify that the quicksort function is working correctly.

## The Output

The output will include:

- The first 10 elements of the unsorted array.
- The first 10 elements of the array sorted by Python's built-in sort function.
- The first 10 elements of the array sorted by the quicksort function.
- A comparison of the 2 sorted arrays (should be true).
- The time taken to sort the array with the quicksort function, rounded to 5 decimal places.

## The expected results
The python sorted array and quicksort sorted array should match and display the same 10 elements.
Additionally, the comparison of the 2 sorted arrays should return true.
